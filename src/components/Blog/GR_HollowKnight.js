                        Because this is my first game rant entry, I'll take a second to describe what this page is all about. It's a rant. There's no structure. Whatever comes to my mind at the time of writing is what I say. I hope these rants are both entertaining and thought provoking.

                        Hollow Knight. This game drew me in immediately. There aren't many cutscenes, but the short animation of The Knight (That's you, the main character) at the start of the game sets the stage for the somber/epic adventure you are about to embark upon. I don't know if there's a single word to that adequately explains the feel of this game. Somber and epic is the shortest description I can do. When I say "epic" I don't mean "awesome." I mean this game tells an epic narrative and takes itself very seriously, and is padded out with lore for the sake of lore. You can literally get to the end of your first play through and have no idea what is really going on in the story if you don't take the time to explore, talk to characters, and read ancient stone tablets throughout the game (Think Metroid Prime). If you do so, you'll find that the adventure you are on is truely an epic, and the narrative itself will draw you in to the point where you feel that your actions in the game are necessary to stop the impending doom that awaits the surviving npcs in the game. Also the game is about little bugs in a little bug kingdom. Not bad right? Apart from the epic tagline, the tone of the game is somber. The color pallet, the music, the dialogue, the settings, all scream "something really bad happened here" and you never quite shake the feeling that victory in this game will never undo the destruction that is presented right at the start.

                        As far as gameplay mechanics go the controls are tight, and require precise mastery in order to navigate the later stages of the game, and to defeat nearly all the bosses. There was no boss I beat on my first encounter. Every boss is beatable with what you have on hand, but there are no glitches, no tricks, no weapon at your disposal that makes bosses "easy." They only become "easy" once you've mastered their psuedo patterns and learn how to react to each of their attacks. Even then, if you make one mistake you're a gonner. This game takes patience, and will most certainly try your patience. Dying in most modern games simply requires you to try again from a checkpoint. While Hollow Knight does have a little bit of this, there is the added feature of losing all your in game currency, and losing attack energy when you respawn at the save station. In order regain your currency you must find your "ghost" and kill it (banish it?). This isn't too big of a problem in most areas. But if you die say over a bunch of spikes, or in an area surrounded by enemies it can really cause you to do a cost benefit analysis on retrieving your money. I'm not going to go into all the gameplay mechanics, but Charms system requires you to analyze challenges you are about to face, and equip the Charms necessary to aid you in what you want to accomplish. Choose carefully though as you have limited space.

                        Without giving too much away the philosophical themes that run through the game's story touch on the ideas of societal success, sacrifice, and the general idea of "doing what must be done." You learn very quickly that the setting of the game was once a great kingdom with a sort of theocratic rule. In order to solidify this rule, the king decided to "seal away" all remembrance of the former religion in one of his own. As I said, I won't give too much away, but throughout the game you get the feeling that in order to prevent eventual destruction, actions were taken that were ... morally questionable. These actions only delayed the impending doom, and the more you dig into the lore, the more you get the feeling of sorrow and regret even though the actions were taken to preserve the success of the kingdom.

                    If you like exploration, lore (you can spend days going through the Hollow Knight Wiki Lore page), beautiful art, music, story, and most importantly, a challenge that will leave you satisfied. Pick up this game give it a play through. You won't be disappointed.
